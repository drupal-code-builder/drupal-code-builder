 * - One component requests another; conversely, every component except for the

 * - Some components are said to contain other components. This represents where
 *   the eventual generated code will be. For example, a class component
 *   contains the components that are its methods.
 *
 * This holds the instantiated components, in several different structures:
 * - The linear list of components, which this class can iterate over.
 * - The tree of components arranged by request, that is, where the components
 *   are arranged according to which component requested which.
 * - The tree of components arranged by containment, that is, where components
 *   are arranged according to which component contains which. This is only
 *   available once assembleContainmentTree() has been called. After this, no
 *   more components may be added.
 * - The list of local names which each component uses when it spawns further
 *   components.
 * - The list of merge tags for components, grouped by closest requesting root,
 *   then type.
