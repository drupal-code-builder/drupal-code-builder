/**
 * Static factory class for creating Drupal Code Builder task handlers.
 *
 * A Task Handler is an object which provides a public API which can be used by
 * different UIs for performing various module builder tasks.
 *
 * The process for using this factory is:
 *  - Set the environment that represents where you are using Drupal Code
 *    Builder, such as Drush or Drupal.
 *  - Get the task handler. This checks the environment to see whether it is
 *    suitably set up for the requested task (e.g., whether the hooks directory
 *    exists, whether hook data has been compiled). This throws an exception if
 *    the environment is not in a state the task requires.
 *  - Execute the required method on the task handler.
 *
 * For example:
 * @code
 *  include_once('path/to/Factory.php');
 *  \DrupalCodeBuilder\Factory::setEnvironmentLocalClass('Drush')
 *    ->setCoreVersionNumber(8);
 *  $task = \DrupalCodeBuilder\Factory::getTask('ReportHookData');
 * @endcode
